    "description"     : "Due to a recent increase in the demand of oral fluid analysis, many challenges have been set forth in developing robust and cost effective assays for determination of illicit drugs. Forensic testing on oral fluids has been increasingly appreciated due to reduction in time, simplicity of collection and reduction of adulteration and substitution. Thus, we developed a simplified and robust assay using filtering vials.",

Groundwater supplies drinking water for 51% of the total U.S. population and 99% of its rural population. Unfortunately, groundwater is susceptible to pollutants due to the widespread use of pesticides and fertilizers. Traditionally, syringe filtration or centrifugation have been used to remove particulates and reduce possible matrix interference prior to LC/ MS analysis. However, these techniques are time consuming, adversely impact reproducibility and quantification. We investigated the potential for streamlining sample preparation method for the analysis of Prosulfuron and its metabolites in ground water using the Thomson Standard|FV compared to syringe filtration and centrifugation.",

The vertical shaker device Vertiga, which generates low-volume high density (A600 ~ 20) Escherichia coli cultures in 96-position deep-well plates without auxiliary oxygen supplementation, has been coupled to a new disposable shake flask design, the Ultra Yield&trade; flask, that allows for equally high cell culture densities to be obtained. The Ultra Yield&trade; flask, which accommodates up to 1L in culture volume, has a baffled base and a more vertical wall construction compared to traditional shake flask designs. Experimental data is presented demonstrating that the Ultra Yield&trade; flask generates, on average, an equivalent amount of recombinant protein per unit cell culture density as do traditional shake flask designs but at a substantially greater amount per unit volume. The combination of Vertiga and the Ultra Yield&trade; flask provides a convenient and scalable low-cost solution to parallel protein production in Escherichia coli.",

    "description"     : "This improved sample preparation method allows for the quantitative measurement of Opioids in urine. Opioids are highly addictive and affects nearly 5 million people in the U.S. Opioids include naturally occurring Opiates, semi-synthetic opioids derived from morphine and synthetic opioids. are analgesic alkaloids found naturally in Papaver somniferum, poppy plant. The use of hydrolysis in the analysis of natural and synthetic opiates in urine has become standard practice in forensic toxicology. Many laboratories currently use solid phase extraction or solid liquid extraction techniques in the sample preparation of urine for the analysis for opiates. This improved automated sample preparation method evaluates the robustness for the quantitative measurement of opiates in urine without the need for SPE/SLE thereby reducing pipetting errors. The sample preparation of incurred urine, controls, standards and internal standard additions as well as the hydrolysis step are performed by a liquid handler. The Thomson eXtreme Filter Vials provide a simple and efficient extraction technique that has demonstrated adequate analyte recovery, reduced matrix interferences and the reduction of solvent and consumable waste.",

    "description"     : "Pesticide analysis of cannabis leaves and finished goods is becoming increasingly important as many states are legalizing it for medicinal and recreational purposes. Dosing methods include smoking/vaporizing and edibles but cannabis is still a Schedule 1 illegal drug and therefore have no FDA testing guidelines. Trace levels of pesticides can be incurred during cultivation or inhaled from dried pesticides on the cannabis. This study evaluates the sample preparation aspect for LC-MS/ MS analysis of a 50+ analyte panel of pesticides, fungicides and aflatoxins. QuEChERS was used to extract the analytes from the cannabis flowers, followed by centrifugation and Thomson Standard Filter Vial for sample clean-up.",

    "description"     : "Several clean-up methods are compared for background reduction, analyte recovery, and cost effectiveness in order to successfully analyze a wide variety of multiclass multiresidues in difficult matrices including Chili Powder and Tobacco. The most critical aspects of reliable multiresidue analysis are the reduction of interferences from the sample matrix and analyte recovery. eXtreme|FV®, were compared to an existing ISO accredited QuEChERS method, as well as a dilute and shoot approach are analyzed in conjunction with different filtration techniques for residue analysis by LC-MS/MS for minimal number of steps, speed, reduced reagent use and reduced cost.",

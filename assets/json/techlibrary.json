    "description"     : "Due to a recent increase in the demand of oral fluid analysis, many challenges have been set forth in developing robust and cost effective assays for determination of illicit drugs. Forensic testing on oral fluids has been increasingly appreciated due to reduction in time, simplicity of collection and reduction of adulteration and substitution. Thus, we developed a simplified and robust assay using filtering vials.",

Groundwater supplies drinking water for 51% of the total U.S. population and 99% of its rural population. Unfortunately, groundwater is susceptible to pollutants due to the widespread use of pesticides and fertilizers. Traditionally, syringe filtration or centrifugation have been used to remove particulates and reduce possible matrix interference prior to LC/ MS analysis. However, these techniques are time consuming, adversely impact reproducibility and quantification. We investigated the potential for streamlining sample preparation method for the analysis of Prosulfuron and its metabolites in ground water using the Thomson Standard|FV compared to syringe filtration and centrifugation.",

The vertical shaker device Vertiga, which generates low-volume high density (A600 ~ 20) Escherichia coli cultures in 96-position deep-well plates without auxiliary oxygen supplementation, has been coupled to a new disposable shake flask design, the Ultra Yield™ flask, that allows for equally high cell culture densities to be obtained. The Ultra Yield™ flask, which accommodates up to 1L in culture volume, has a baffled base and a more vertical wall construction compared to traditional shake flask designs. Experimental data is presented demonstrating that the Ultra Yield™ flask generates, on average, an equivalent amount of recombinant protein per unit cell culture density as do traditional shake flask designs but at a substantially greater amount per unit volume. The combination of Vertiga and the Ultra Yield™ flask provides a convenient and scalable low-cost solution to parallel protein production in Escherichia coli.",

    "description"     : "This improved sample preparation method allows for the quantitative measurement of Opioids in urine. Opioids are highly addictive and affects nearly 5 million people in the U.S. Opioids include naturally occurring Opiates, semi-synthetic opioids derived from morphine and synthetic opioids. are analgesic alkaloids found naturally in Papaver somniferum, poppy plant. The use of hydrolysis in the analysis of natural and synthetic opiates in urine has become standard practice in forensic toxicology. Many laboratories currently use solid phase extraction or solid liquid extraction techniques in the sample preparation of urine for the analysis for opiates. This improved automated sample preparation method evaluates the robustness for the quantitative measurement of opiates in urine without the need for SPE/SLE thereby reducing pipetting errors. The sample preparation of incurred urine, controls, standards and internal standard additions as well as the hydrolysis step are performed by a liquid handler. The Thomson eXtreme Filter Vials provide a simple and efficient extraction technique that has demonstrated adequate analyte recovery, reduced matrix interferences and the reduction of solvent and consumable waste.",

    "description"     : "Pesticide analysis of cannabis leaves and finished goods is becoming increasingly important as many states are legalizing it for medicinal and recreational purposes. Dosing methods include smoking/vaporizing and edibles but cannabis is still a Schedule 1 illegal drug and therefore have no FDA testing guidelines. Trace levels of pesticides can be incurred during cultivation or inhaled from dried pesticides on the cannabis. This study evaluates the sample preparation aspect for LC-MS/ MS analysis of a 50+ analyte panel of pesticides, fungicides and aflatoxins. QuEChERS was used to extract the analytes from the cannabis flowers, followed by centrifugation and Thomson Standard Filter Vial for sample clean-up.",

    "description"     : "The evolution of shaken flasks for biotechnological applications began in the 1940s with the increased interest in the microbial production of antibiotics [1]. The Nobel Prize awarded production of streptomycin by Streptomyces actinobacteria showed the main disadvantage of static cultures: slow growth. Hence, shaking platforms were constructed and an already established, readily available vessel was used: the Erlenmeyer flask [2]. Nowadays, the usage of shaking flasks is widespread due to their easy handling and thus, those reactors are preferred for use used in upstream processing [3]. In recent years, numerous articles about shake flask, e.g. about general engineering aspects [4], power consumption [3, 5-6], or gas exchange [7-8], have been published, underlining the importance of shake flask in biotechnology. However, the design hasn’t changed significantly. Erlenmeyer and Fernbach style shake flask are still the predominant designs [2], despite their disadvantages (e.g. the relatively low filling volumes [1]). Consequently, the Thomson Instrument Company introduced a new shake flask design for cell cultures (Optimum Growth™), claiming higher yield on the same shaker footprint [9]. This poster gives an overview of different procedural parameters for the 500 mL and 5 L Optimum Growth™ flasks, enabling scientist to compare and evaluate the new design and to choose suitable cultivation conditions.",

    "description"     : "Use of oral fluid (saliva) in toxicology has been increasing within recent years due to its non-invasive, low cost effectiveness in recent drug use detection. There is little opportunity for adulteration of the sample and a large volume is not required for collection and analysis. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has proven to be a useful tool in the analysis of oral fluid due to its ability to run highly sensitive assays1. The necessity for a sensitive assay is especially important in the detection of an analyte and its analogues that are administered in low concentrations. Detection of fentanyl and its analogues such as furanyl fentanyl and sufentanil, have become important due to the increasing widespread use of illicit fentanyl formulations in heroin and counterfeit opioid tablet formulations. Suppliers of illicit heroin are developing fentanyl analogues and including them as cutting agents in the final product due to their high potency and relatively low production cost2. As a result, development of a method to detect these compounds has become vital to many toxicology labs. Thomson eXtreme Filter Vials provide a simple and efficient extraction technique that has demonstrated adequate analyte recovery, reduced matrix interferences from a simple dilute-and-shoot method and the elimination of solvent waste and other consumables. This project specifically explores the efficacy of these vials in extracting a range of fentanyl analogues in oral fluid specimens.",

    "description"     : "Protein aggregation in therapeutic products has become a major concern for the pharmaceutical industry and regulatory agencies. Protein aggregates can cause adverse patient immune responses and therefore are typically monitored throughout the formulation and production of bio-therapeutics. Monitoring aggregates by HPLC during production, storage and shipping is a part of the process of optimizing early formulations to minimize risk in clinical applications. Many clean-up techniques used to prepare cell culture samples prior to HPLC/UPLC provide incomplete clean-up, are time consuming, and waste precious sample. The presence of cellular debris remaining after sample preparation can lead to analytical instrument performance issues and will shorten column life. Here, we demonstrate how the use of Thomson Filter Vials for sample preparation allows for the analysis of low volume samples, processed in less time, with minimal sample loss and fewer transfer steps while extending column lifetimes and reducing HPLC/UPLC downtime.",

    "description"     : "The Dicer family of ribonucleases plays a key role in small RNA-based regulatory pathways by generating short dsRNA fragments that modulate expression of endogenous genes, or protect the host from invasive nucleic acids. Beginning with its initial discovery, biochemical characterization of Dicer has provided insight about its catalytic properties. However, a comprehensive understanding of how Dicer’s domains contribute to substrate-specific recognition and catalysis is lacking. One reason for this void is the lack of high-resolution structural information for a metazoan Dicer in the apo- or substrate-bound state. Both biochemical and structural studies are facilitated by large amounts of highly purified, active protein, and Dicer enzymes have historically been recalcitrant to overexpression and purification. Here we describe optimized procedures for the large-scale expression of Dicer in baculovirus-infected insect cells. We then outline a three-step protocol for the purification of large amounts (3–4 mg of Dicer per liter of insect cell culture) of highly purified and active Dicer protein, suitable for biochemical and structural studies. Our methods are general and are extended to enable overexpression, purification and biochemical characterization of accessory dsRNA binding proteins that interact with Dicer and modulate its catalytic activity.",

    "description"     : "Membrane proteins are currently the most common targets for pharmaceuticals. However, characterization of their structural dynamics by hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) is sparse due to insufficient automated methods to handle full-length membrane proteins in lipid bilayers. Additionally, membrane lipids used to mimic the membrane environment and to solubilize membrane proteins can impair chromatography performance and cause ion suppression in the mass spectrometer. The workflow discussed herein advances HDX-MS capabilities and other MS applications for membrane proteins by providing a fully automated method for HDX-MS analysis based on a phospholipid removal scheme compatible with robotic handling. Phospholipids were depleted from protein samples by the addition of zirconium oxide beads, which were subsequently removed by inline filtration using syringeless nanofilters. To demonstrate this method, single-pass transmembrane protein FcγRIIa (CD32a) expressed into liposomes was used. Successful depletion of phospholipids ensured optimal liquid-chromatography−mass-spectrometry performance, and measurement of peptides from the transmembrane domain of FcγRIIa indicated phospholipids associated with this region were either not present or did not shield the transmembrane domain from digestion by pepsin. Furthermore, amino acid sequence coverage provided by this method was suitable to enable future measurement of structural dynamics of ectodomain, transmembrane domain, and endodomain of FcγRIIa. Moreover, this method is the first to enable fully automated HDX-MS on full-length transmembrane proteins in lipid bilayers, a notable advancement to facilitate understanding of membrane proteins, development of pharmaceuticals, and characterization for regulatory agencies.",

    "description"     : "In this study, we examined the applicability of the ADAPT platform to sdAb affinity maturation while continuing our efforts towards improved therapies for Clostridium difficile infections (CDI). Treatment of CDI with antibiotics can result in recurrent forms of this highly common and costly hospital-acquired disease. With the emergence of antibiotic-resistant and hypervirulent C. difficile strains, CDI-associated health-care costs and morbidity rates have prompted alternative treatment modalities including vaccines, fecal transplantation, probiotics and antibody-based immunotherapy. With regard to antibody-based immunotherapy, a number of mAbs targeting and neutralizing C. difficile virulence-factor toxins A and B (TcdA and TcdB) have been discovered, with the anti-TcdB mAb bezlotoxumab recently passing a Phase III clinical trial and obtaining FDA-approval. SdAbs are also attractive immunotherapeutics, as they present several advantages over mAbs, primarily in terms of ability to access cryptic and concave epitopes, increased stabilities, high modularity and smaller size, thus potentially leading to excellent efficacy, pharmacokinetics and developability profiles.",

    "description"     : "Fluorescent proteins are an important tool that has become omnipresent in life sciences research. They are frequently used for localization of proteins and monitoring of cells. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) was the first and has been the most used fluorescent protein. Enhanced GFP (eGFP) was optimized from wild-type GFP for increased fluorescence yield and improved expression in mammalian systems. Many GFP-like fluorescent proteins have been discovered, optimized or created, such as the red fluorescent protein TagRFP. Fluorescent proteins are expressed colorless and immature and, for eGFP, the conversion to the fluorescent form, mature, is known to produce one equivalent of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) per molecule of chromophore. Even though it has been proposed that this process is non-catalytic and generates nontoxic levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, this study investigates the role of fluorescent proteins in generating free radicals and inducing oxidative stress in biological systems. Immature eGFP and TagRFP catalytically generate the free radical superoxide anion (O<sub>2</sub> •–) and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the presence of NADH. Generation of the free radical O<sub>2</sub> •– and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by eGFP in the presence of NADH affects the gene expression of cells. Many biological pathways are altered, such as a decrease in HIF1α stabilization and activity. The biological pathways altered by eGFP are known to be implicated in the pathophysiology of many diseases associated with oxidative stress; therefore, it is critical that such experiments using fluorescent proteins are validated with alternative methodologies and the results are carefully interpreted. Since cells inevitably experience oxidative stress when fluorescent proteins are expressed, the use of this tool for cell labeling and in vivo cell tracing also requires validation using alternative methodologies.",

The chromatographic separation was performed using a hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) column and typical LC–MS mobile phases. Method performance was evaluated, showing excellent results. The low limits of quantification (LLOQs) obtained meet the requirements of EU guidelines and could also be used to get an agreement in France where regulations require lower LLOQs (NOR: DEVL1703763V).",

    "description"     : "There is increasing demand for genuine cocoa butter (CB) in chocolate products in developed nations, however, this demand has created a shortage of CB and raised its costs. To overcome this, chocolate manufactures sometimes add vegetable-derived fats to some chocolate products to reduce costs while still maintaining desirable physical characteristics. It is of current interest to have a reliable method to detect, identify, and quantify the triacylglycerol (TAG) components of cocoa butter substitutes, replacers, and equivalents (CBEs) in chocolate products. Traditionally GC was used for this task, but due to the low volatility of triacylglycerides and their susceptibility to thermal decomposition, retention time is the only identifying factor for the TAGs and typical GC analyses of this type can take 40 minutes. LCMS is able to not only provide faster throughput, but also has the additional advantage of allowing characterization of the TAG, including qualitative regiospecific analysis. We have developed a single, UHPLC column-based LCMS method to analyze the TAG components in commercial chocolate and chocolate-like products. This analysis has a runtime of 17minutes, making it suitable for relatively high throughput. Additionally, the method was very repeatable, with an interday variability of <7% for the absolute area counts of the three major TAGs in CB (POP,POS,SOS).",

    "description"     : "Use of oral fluid (saliva) in toxicology has been increasing within recent years due to its non-invasive, low cost effectiveness in recent drug use detection. There is little opportunity for adulteration of the sample and a large volume is not required for collection and analysis. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has proven to be a useful tool in the analysis of oral fluid due to its ability to run highly sensitive assays1. The necessity for a sensitive assay is especially important in the detection of an analyte and its analogues that are administered in low concentrations. Detection of fentanyl and its analogues such as furanyl fentanyl and sufentanil, have become important due to the increasing widespread use of illicit fentanyl formulations in heroin and counterfeit opioid tablet formulations. Suppliers of illicit heroin are developing fentanyl analogues and including them as cutting agents in the final product due to their high potency and relatively low production cost2. As a result, development of a method to detect these compounds has become vital to many toxicology labs. Thomson eXtreme Filter Vials provide a simple and efficient extraction technique that has demonstrated adequate analyte recovery, reduced matrix interferences from a simple dilute-and-shoot method and the elimination of solvent waste and other consumables. This project specifically explores the efficacy of these vials in extracting a range of fentanyl analogues in oral fluid specimens.",

Measuring the chemical contents and accuately labelling edible products has been a challenge to the cannabis industry.  A recent study published by the Journal of the American Medical Society (JAMA) regarding cannabinoid (mis)-labeling in edible medical cannabis products, Dr. Ryan Vandrey of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine looked at 75 products from 47 separate brands purchased at medical dispensaries. Items included baked goods, beverages, and chocolate/candy. Their criteria for selection included those items with a specifically-stated cannabinoid content level. The results, indicated only 17% of edibles tested were “accurately” labeled. The results indicated a +/- 10% range of the stated THC content for beverages and baked goods while baked goods where off by +/- 25%. This could lead to over and under usage which could represent a safety concern. We looked at streamlining the sample prep and analysis of THC in candy.",
